If it is your first time, start slow. Rushing will only make it harder.
When you find yourself under a larger platform, you can jump and immediately swap dimension to fly through it.
Stripes at the bottom of the screen show you how much double jumps you can do. Look for energy pickups to refill them.
Fire and ice traps/enemies are present only in their respective dimensions, so you can avoid them by swapping it.
If you need to go faster you can dash down to be able to land immediately.
We recommend playing with volume on. Enemies and traps produce sound before they appear on the screen.
